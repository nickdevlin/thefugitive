<h1>The Fugitive</h1>
<h3>A site dedicated to the best movie</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Nick, and welcome to my website. It exists because, during the '90s, NBC did a bold thing by deciding to show a movie of the week every Sunday night. This wouldn't be bold because most networks have the volume of feature films to sustain such a project. Not NBC. NBC showed The Fugitive basically every third week. And every third week, I watched The Fugitive. Because it fucking rules.</p>
Some fun facts about The Fugitive:
<ul>
	<li>It was directed by Andrew Davis (whoever that is).</li>
	<li>Tommy Lee Jones won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his work on the film.</li>
	<li>Many of the scenes said to take place in rural Illinois were actually shot in North Carolina, a state best known for not looking like Illinois. </li>
</ul>

<p>Above is me in Dillsboro, N.C., visiting one of the sites where the movie was filmed. In the movie, there's a scene where an Illinois Department of Corrections bus carrying Dr. Richard Kimble (the eponymous Fugitive, played by Harrison Ford) is struck by a train. The wreckage from filming this scene was left in place after shooting. It isn't easy to get it, but it's a rewarding journey for the determined fans of the film. This is me reenacting Kimble's jump from the bus.</p>

<p>Interested in the TV show on which the movie was based? <a href="http://www.unchance.net/Fugitive/">Click here</a> to check out a fansite. It's not a very good site. Many of the pages lack content, while under say "under construction," a claim I find dubious at best. It contains a link to an audio file of the theme song and a way to get a hold of the webmaster, but it shows nothing in the way of dynamic content or me pretending to jump out of a bus.</p>
