<img src="moore.jpg">
<p class="info">While she's best known for larger roles in Boogie Nights, Children of Men, and The Big Lebowski, Julianne Moore's big break came when she played Dr. Anne Eastman in The Fugitive. In the film, her character tells Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Form), who is disguised as a janitor as he attempts to prove that he was framed for the murder of his wife, to help the busy staff of doctors out by wheeling a child to an observation room. When she sees Kimble looking at the child's x-rays, she suspects something to be amiss. Moore won an Oscar in 2015 for her work in the film Still Alice.</p>
